# Bass-Model

This repository contains an analysis of the AI Dating Assistant, using the Bass Diffusion Model to estimate user adoption parameters. The model is applied to predict the future diffusion of the Rizz app(an AI-powered dating assistant) based on data from existing online dating service users.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to:

1.Estimate the Bass model parameters (p and q) based on online dating service user data.
2.Use these estimated parameters to make predictions about the adoption of the AI Dating Assistant (Rizz).
3.Submit a detailed report outlining the methodology, results, and analysis.

###How to Run

1.Clone this repository.
2.Open and run HW_Bass Model.rmd in R or RStudio.
3.Ensure the necessary libraries (ggplot2, nls, etc.) are installed before running the code.
